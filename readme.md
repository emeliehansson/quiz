# Emelie's Quiz

I have created this quiz for the first submission in the Programming course. It's a quiz where the questions are based on
three different categories, at the moment. As a future addition I would like to add more categories and for the user to 
be able to choose the category with an if/else statement and have the program only displaying the questions in that 
category instead of how it displays the questions now.

I would also like to add classes and tidy up the code more, maybe having the classes in different files instead. As well
as adding a feature of multiple choice questions.

### Issues:
During this process I haven't had any major issues, bugs or problems. Just some syntax errors where I have been able
to google the solutions for the problems. 

### Credits:
The code in the if statement in the fetchUserInput function is borrowed from the Adventure Game Jimmy has built during lessons.
